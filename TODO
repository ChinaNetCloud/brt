        - Super Viewer (P6)
        - Customer Admin (P7)
        - Customer Engineer (P7)

    - Change Configs. (P10)
    - BRT: no report should say for how long. If more than 3 days show Yellow, if more than a week should show RED. so at the and should read something like: No report (3 days)
DONE:
    - Show page name on the title.
    - Add paging feature.
    - Limit (Results count).
    - Add links to the top in general template and document pending here.
    - Enable Active in the search.

    - The report does not have ends of line therefore reading the log is hard.
